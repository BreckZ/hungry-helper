# Hungry-Helper


<br>

## Overview

The Hungry Helper application is designed to store user recipes in a single location accessible via the web.  Users can add favorite recipes along with editing their existing ones.  This database of recipes also provides users with a mobile experience to make the food preparation process more accessible rather than dealing with books, recipe boxes, and other paper cataloging systems.

## MVP

### Server (Back End)
Have a RESTful JSON API.
Build a Ruby on Rails server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
Build a database with at least 3 tables:
There must be at least 1 association between your tables. (1:m or m:m)
Utilize Rails to define models for interacting with the database.
Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (index, show, create, update, delete) between your non-User tables
Note that if you choose to do Authentication, CRUD on your User table does not count toward this requirement.

### Client (Front End)
Have a working, interactive React app, built using npx create-react-app.
Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
Utilize functional or class React components appropriately.
Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
Use only React for DOM Manipulation.
Consume data from your Ruby on Rails API, and render that data in your components.
Utilize React Router, for client-side routing.
Demonstrate Full CRUD actions ( index, show, create, update, and delete ) on the front end.
Note that if you decide to implement Auth, your full CRUD actions must be covered amongst your non-User tables.

### Styling
Be styled with CSS (or SCSS, if you'd prefer).
Use Flexbox or Grid in your layout design.
Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop).

### Deployment
Deploy the fully functional front-end via Surge or Netlify.
Deploy the back-end via Heroku.
Deploy early and often(this will help to debug small issues before they become large issues)
Procedural
Initialize a git repo on Github, with a link to your hosted project.
Have frequent commits, making a robust commit history at least every day. (75 commits minimum)
Use effective and safe branching and merging processes.

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/davidtwhitlatch/414107e2560ae0bb65e233570f2fe056#file-component-tree-png)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.
