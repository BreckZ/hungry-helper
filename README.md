# Hungry-Helper


<br>

## Overview

The Hungry Helper application is designed to store user recipes in a single location accessible via the web.  Users can add favorite recipes along with editing their existing ones.  This database of recipes also provides users with a mobile experience to make the food preparation process more accessible rather than dealing with books, recipe boxes, and other paper cataloging systems.
